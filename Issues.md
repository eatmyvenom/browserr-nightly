# Issues

Issues in this repositiory are to be structured for basically just helpfulness to everyone

## Rules

All issues are simply subject to rules so it is very easy for developers to help and things like that.
The rules are as follows:

1. All issues published must follow the style guide found below.
2. All issues must be useful in some way, in practice this means basically don't bash on something or be negative.
3. All replies must be helpful in some way, it doesn't have to be a solution but it does have to be related.
4. Keep your issues and progress up to date, if you have a problem and end up finiding a solution, please post it.

## Syle Guide

Issues no matter what type should be essentally all the same.
As this is markdown centered in github, lets make use of that.

  * Decent titles
  * Start with a "## Current Behavior"
  * Describe what you encounter as you use the code from the repository
  * To describe what you would like to see, start that section with "## Wanted Behavior"
  * Descibe in as much detail as possible what you would like to see instead of the current behavior
  * If possible include code snippits

  * End with the NodeJS version followed by the Electron version followed by this repositories version (that was used for the test)

### Example

> ## Current Behavior
> Currently the maximize button is not rounded enough and does not align the bottom line with the minimize button
> This is not only slightly bothersome but also contrubutes to a poor feeling UI/UX
> ## Wanted Behavior
> Consider going through all icons and changing them. If that is simply too much work, look into icon packs that are good for this application.
>
>
>
> ```NodeJS version : 11.1.0; ElectronJS version : 4.0.7; Browserr version : 1.0.0;```
